ARTIQUE
In today's day and age, where things from the past are discarded and trends come and go before you know it. Artique, as a company, provides a platform for the growth of local artists who practice traditional art forms. We aim to provide a medium for the revival of art forms that are on the brink of extinction. Now talking about our features, artists can list their physical as well as digital artwork as NFTs on the website. NFTs allow users to have ownership of their digital assets, It serves as a digital ledger, making transfer of ownership much simpler. The homepage later takes you to our featured section, bringing the spotlight to our unsung artists. This hopefully creates a sense of awareness among the people about the richness of their culture and heritage. The newsletter feature on the website gives us more meaningful insight into various artworks. Upon logging in, the user can decide to be an artist or an enthusiast. This will essentially allow the users to keep a discography of their entire art collection, be it a collector or a painter.
